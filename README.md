For which teammate did you implement “Microservice A”?: Fariss
How is your teammate going to access your microservice?: Github Repo

If your teammate cannot access/call YOUR microservice, what should they do? Can you be available to 
help them? What’s your availability?: I will be available to help but I am currently really busy with school work so I might not respond very often.

If your teammate cannot access/call your microservice, by when do they need to tell you?: No by when date, but I would prefer
to be told sooner rather than later because I expect to become very busy as it gets closer to finals week.

Is there anything else your teammate needs to know? Anything you’re worried about? Any assumptions 
you’re making?: No

Any other mitigations / backup plans you want to mention or want to discuss with your teammate?: No
